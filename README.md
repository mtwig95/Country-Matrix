The project was written as part of the course " 20441 - Introduction to Computer Science Using Java" in my degree (Computer Science at the Open University).

#country

This project is a follow-up project to the city from repositories Point&City.
The program represents countries with the help of an array that maintains the list of cities and includes the country name attributes, city array and number of cities in the country.
There is a builder for initializing the features of the department, there are methods for adding a city to the country, total number of residents, the largest distance between two cities, printing information about all the cities in the country, a method for uniting cities and more.

#matrix

The class represents a two-dimensional array of integers in the range 0-255. The matrix represents a two-dimensional image in black and white, with the numbers representing the shades of gray in the image.
There are methods that turn the matrix around the horizontal axis, most likely the vertical axis, rotating the image 90 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise.
